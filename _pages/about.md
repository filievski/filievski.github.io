Hello! I am a PhD student in Natural Language Processing in my fourth (last) year. 
My supervisors are professor Piek Vossen, professor Frank Van Harmelen, associate professor Stefan Schlobach, and Marieke van Erp.
In 2017, I spent ~7 months as a research visitor at the Language Technologies Institute at Carnegie Mellon University, under supervision of professor Ed Hovy.

I have been investigating *how to improve the ability of semantic NLP systems when interpreting long-tail identities*. In my thesis, I propose focusing on five aspects of this challenge: description/definition, analysis, improvement of evaluation, enabling access to more knowledge, and building knowledge-intensive systems. The topics covered and the skills employed stem from ideas in various AI fields: **semantic NLP**, **semantic web**, and **neural networks**.

Previously, I completed an Artificial Intelligence Master at VU Amsterdam with a cum laude honor. I have experience with a wide range of programming languages, databases, and techniques. My preferred programming language is Python (particularly the scientific Python stack). 

For a detailed information on my experience, skills, teaching, reviewing, organization, etc., please check my CV.

After obtaining my PhD degree, I intend to proceed working on the long-tail challenge in NLP by applying AI methods.
