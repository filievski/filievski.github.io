## Open positions
I am currently working on growing my team at VU Amsterdam. I like collaborating with strong students with a passion for human-centric AI and NLP research and learning about state-of-the-art technologies like language models and neuro-symbolic systems. I am also looking to hire Postdocs to work with me on important topics relating to analogies and complex reasoning. 

For concrete open positions, see [this group page](https://lr.cs.vu.nl/about/jobs). Note that there are usually other positions that are about to open, so if you are interested in working with me as a PhD student or a Postdoc, get in touch with me via email.
