## News
* I am chairing [The First Workshop on Analogical Abstraction in Cognition, Perception, and Language (Analogy-ANGLE)](https://analogy-angle.github.io/) at IJCAI 2024 in August.
* On May 2nd and 3rd, I hosted Wael AbdAlmageed at VU Amsterdam. Wael gave a talk entitled [Truth Decay - Plausible Deniability: The Liarâ€™s Dividend](https://vu.nl/en/events/2024/talk-by-prof-wael-abdalmageed) and met with members of the AI groups at the VU and UvA.
* In late April, I visited the Japanese Science and Technology Agency (JST) and several universities in Tokyo and Sendai. During this trip, I talked about commonsense AI for good at JST and AIRC, and we explored future collaborations. 
* Welcome to the three new additions to my common sense AI team this Spring: Hossein Khojasteh, Mehdi Jafari, and Ruthu Rooparaghunath. They are joining me as research assistants on the Humane AI project of developing personalized recommendations for educational materials. 
* I am co-chairing [the Generative NeuroSymbolic AI (GeNeSy) workshop at ESWC 2024](https://sites.google.com/view/genesy2024/home?authuser=0).
* I am organizing a Dagstuhl seminar on [Generalization by Humans and Machines](https://www.dagstuhl.de/seminars/seminar-calendar/seminar-details/24192) from 5th to 8th of May 2024. We have 30 participants from various disciplines, including machine learning, neuro-symbolic AI, computer vision, natural language processing, and cognitive psychology.
* Best student paper award for Prateek at K-CAP for the paper "Knowledge-enhanced Agents for Interactive Text Games".


## Open positions
I am currently working on growing my team at VU Amsterdam. I like collaborating with strong students passionate about human-centric AI with common sense and state-of-the-art technologies like language models and neuro-symbolic systems. I am also looking to hire Postdocs to work with me on important topics relating to analogies and complex reasoning. 

For concrete open positions, see [this group page](https://lr.cs.vu.nl/about/jobs). Note that there are usually other positions that are about to open, so if you are interested in working with me as a PhD student or a Postdoc, contact me via email.
