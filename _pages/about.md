Hello! I am a PhD student in Natural Language Processing in my fourth (last) year. 
I am supervised by <a href="http://vossen.info/">professor Piek Vossen</a>, <a href="https://www.cs.vu.nl/~frank.van.harmelen/">professor Frank Van Harmelen</a>, <a href="http://www.few.vu.nl/~schlobac/">associate professor Stefan Schlobach</a>, and <a href="https://mariekevanerp.com/">Marieke van Erp</a>.
In 2017, I spent ~7 months as a research visitor at the Language Technologies Institute at Carnegie Mellon University, under supervision of professor <a href="https://www.cs.cmu.edu/~hovy/">Ed Hovy</a>.

I have been investigating *how to improve the ability of semantic NLP systems when interpreting long-tail identities*. In my thesis, I propose focusing on five aspects of this challenge: description/definition, analysis, improvement of evaluation, enabling access to more knowledge, and building knowledge-intensive systems. The topics covered and the skills employed stem from ideas in various AI fields: **semantic NLP**, **semantic web**, and **neural networks**.

Previously, I completed an Artificial Intelligence Master at VU Amsterdam with a cum laude honor. I have experience with a wide range of programming languages, databases, and techniques. My preferred programming language is Python (particularly the scientific Python stack). 

For a detailed information on my experience, skills, teaching, reviewing, organization, etc., please check my <a href="/files/CV.prf">CV</a>.

After obtaining my PhD degree, I intend to proceed working on the long-tail challenge in NLP by applying AI methods.
