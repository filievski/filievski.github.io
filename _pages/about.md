## Open positions
I am currently working on growing my team at VU Amsterdam. I like collaborating with strong students who are passionate about human-centric AI with common sense and state-of-the-art technologies like language models and neuro-symbolic systems. 

During these months, I am hiring **PhD students and Postdocs** for my newly granted cross-disciplinary project, "Human-Centric AI with Common Sense," which is [funded by NWO AiNed's program](https://vu.nl/en/news/2024/nwo-ained-fellowship-grant-awarded-to-filip-ilievski). The topics focus on value-aware AI, analogical abstraction, and developing world models with common sense. The calls for these positions are ongoing (some have been closed, and the rest are/will be open).

Please apply if you are interested in these topics and would like to work with me as a PhD student or a Postdoc. If you cannot find (an adequate) call where you can apply, contact me via email, as the next position is likely coming out shortly.

## News
* I am chairing [The First Workshop on Analogical Abstraction in Cognition, Perception, and Language (Analogy-ANGLE)](https://analogy-angle.github.io/) at IJCAI 2024 in August.
* On May 2nd and 3rd, I hosted Wael AbdAlmageed at VU Amsterdam. Wael gave a talk entitled [Truth Decay - Plausible Deniability: The Liarâ€™s Dividend](https://vu.nl/en/events/2024/talk-by-prof-wael-abdalmageed) and met with members of the AI groups at the VU and UvA.
* In late April, I visited the Japanese Science and Technology Agency (JST) and several universities in Tokyo and Sendai. During this trip, I talked about commonsense AI for good at JST and AIRC, and we explored future collaborations.
* In April 2024, I submitted the book ``Human-centric AI with Common Sense'' to the Springer Nature
Synthesis series. This is an invited publication and will be published later this year.
* Welcome to the three new additions to my common sense AI team this Spring: Hossein Khojasteh, Mehdi Jafari, and Ruthu Rooparaghunath. They are joining me as research assistants on the Humane AI project of developing personalized recommendations for educational materials. 
* I am co-chairing [the Generative NeuroSymbolic AI (GeNeSy) workshop at ESWC 2024](https://sites.google.com/view/genesy2024/home?authuser=0).
* I am organizing a Dagstuhl seminar on [Generalization by Humans and Machines](https://www.dagstuhl.de/seminars/seminar-calendar/seminar-details/24192) from 5th to 8th of May 2024. We have 30 participants from various disciplines, including machine learning, neuro-symbolic AI, computer vision, natural language processing, and cognitive psychology.
* Best student paper award for Prateek at K-CAP for our work [Knowledge-enhanced Agents for Interactive Text Games](https://dl.acm.org/doi/10.1145/3587259.3627561).
