## News

* For VU/UvA AI students: I am now accepting thesis supervision students for Spring 2026. The list of topics will soon be published on our group's Canvas page.
* I am teaching two courses this Fall: [Conversational AI (BSc)](https://studiegids.vu.nl/en/courses/2024-2025/XB_0119#/) and [The Social Web (MSc)](https://studiegids.vu.nl/EN/courses/2024-2025/X_405086#/).
* Our Nature Machine Intelligence article, a product of a [productive Dagstuhl seminar in May 2024](https://drops.dagstuhl.de/entities/document/10.4230/DagRep.14.5.1), is now published. The publicly accessible version can be found [here](https://rdcu.be/eH1AJ).
* On September 15, two new PhDs join my lab: 1) [Shaurya Gaur](https://scholar.google.com/citations?user=LoZr4WsAAAAJ&hl=en&oi=ao), who will explore software architectures for human-centric AI in collaboration with Justus Bogner (software architectures); and 2) [TC Chen](https://scholar.google.com/citations?user=XoElL5oAAAAJ&hl=en&oi=ao), who will research multimodal alignment with common sense, in collaboration with Shujian Yu (machine learning).
* During June and July, two MSc students from the University of Montpellier (group led by Madelina Croitoru), with a background in robotics, visited our lab: Mehdi Soltani and Luca Vogelsang.
* During the summer of 2025, I am attending ICWSM (Copenhagen, to present a paper), ACL (Vienna, to host the Analogy-Angle II workshop), and a Dagstuhl seminar on Neurosymbolic AI (Germany).
* In June-July, we welcome two new Postdocs: 1) [Emile van Krieken](https://emilevankrieken.com/), who will explore commonsense reasoning with multimodal foundation models, and 2) [Stefano De Giorgis](https://stendoipanni.github.io/), who will research knowledge-informed reasoning about the harmfulness of internet memes.
* On Feb 3 and 4, I visited Konstantin Todorov and colleagues at the LIRMM (the Montpellier Laboratory of Computer Science, Robotics, and Microelectronics) institute. I will give a talk about what it takes to understand internet memes.
* I gave a talk in the Neurosymbolic AI (NAI) seminar series at the end of January about [Abstraction and Reasoning Beyond Foundation Models](https://www.linkedin.com/posts/pascalhitzler_abstraction-and-reasoning-beyond-foundation-activity-7275974165189275648-6fPF/). The seminar recording will soon appear on NAI's YouTube channel.
* My book [Human-Centric AI with Common Sense](https://link.springer.com/book/10.1007/978-3-031-69974-0) is now published in the Springer Nature Synthesis series.
* The second iteration of our workshop Analogy-Angle ([Analogy-Angle II](https://analogy-angle.github.io)) will be co-located with ACl 2025 in Vienna.
* Welcome to [Gabriella Bollici](https://nl.linkedin.com/in/gabriella-bollici-bab32123b), who joined our group as a PhD student on December 1st. Gabriella will be supervised by me and Wouter van Atteveldt (professor of political science) and will explore narratives in internet memes.
* I joined [the ELLIS society](https://ellis.eu). ELLIS stands for "European Laboratory for Learning and Intelligent Systems".
* Two Master's theses I supervised in Spring 2024 were accepted at A* and A conferences: [COLUMBUS, Koen Kraaijveld's thesis,](https://columbus-vqa.github.io/) was accepted at AAAI 2025, while [Tygo Bloem's work on multi-dimensional clustering of internet memes](https://ojs.aaai.org/index.php/ICWSM/article/view/35815/37969) was published at ICWSM 2025.
* I was interviewed for the BBC article [When robots can't riddle: What puzzles reveal about the depths of our own minds
](https://www.bbc.com/future/article/20240912-what-riddles-teach-us-about-the-human-mind). The research I described was conducted with Koen Kraaijveld, Yifan Jiang, and Kaixin Ma. The article is part of the series "AI v. the Mind," which explores "the limits of cutting-edge AI and learns a little about how our own brains work along the way."
