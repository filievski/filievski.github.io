## Open positions
I am currently working on growing my team at VU Amsterdam. I like collaborating with strong students who are passionate about human-centric AI with common sense and state-of-the-art technologies like language models and neuro-symbolic systems. 

As of August 2024, I am looking for a **PhD student** on the cross-disciplinary topic of [Value-aware interpretation of Internet Memes](https://workingat.vu.nl/vacancies/value-aware-interpretation-of-internet-memes-ai-meets-communication-science-amsterdam-1090828), in collaboration with a communication scientist.

I am also looking to hire **Postdocs** to work with me on analogies, internet memes, and visual reasoning. The calls for these positions should be out during the Fall.

Note that there are usually other positions about to open, so if you are interested in working with me as a PhD student or a Postdoc, contact me via email.
