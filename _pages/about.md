## Open positions
I like collaborating with strong students with a passion for AI research and learning about state-of-the-art technologies like language models and neuro-symbolic systems. I am also looking to hire Postdocs to work with me on important topics relating to analogical reasoning and complex reasoning in the democracy domain.

As of January 2024, I currently have the following positions open:
1. **8-month Postdoc (1.0FTE)** and/or a **PhD intern** to investigate the topic of analogical reasoning over educational materials
2. **10-month Postdoc (1.0FTE)** and a **Master student RA** to research complex systems for combating threats to democracy like misinformation and hate speech through human-AI teaming
3. Two **Master Student Research Assistants** (1 day a week for 5.5 months) to work on devising a knowledge-based AI tool for supporting sustainable policymaking in an interdisciplinary collaboration with a life cycle analysis expert

If interested in any of these positions, send me an email.
