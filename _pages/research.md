## Academic Profile
I am an AI researcher with international experience in Natural Language Processing and Knowledge Representation and Reasoning, and a cross-disciplinary perspective on the fundamental challenges of commonsense reasoning, robustness, and explainability. I hold a PhD in Natural Language Processing from VUA’s Faculty of Humanities. With dedicated PhD mentors from two faculties, including profs. Vossen and van Harmelen, I learned to recognize and appreciate diverse perspectives. I am continuously inspired to pass this on through mentorship and by being a role model for my own students. My PhD focus area was the (still) understudied challenge of identifying long-tail entities in text, where my responsible AI approach was based on knowledge engineering processes informed by linguistic and philosophical theories of reference. During a six-month PhD research visit to prof. Hovy at CMU’s prestigious Language Technologies Institute, I first gained a transatlantic perspective and explored cognitively inspired methods for generalization over entity knowledge.

After completing my PhD and a short postdoctoral position, my interest in responsible and generalizable AI led me to address the longstanding AI challenge of commonsense reasoning at the University of Southern California’s renowned Information Sciences Institute (USC/ISI). Quickly, I grew into a research lead at USC/ISI and became a Research Assistant Professor at USC’s Computer Science department. With my team, I developed new methods for generalizable out-of-domain reasoning by leveraging curriculum learning, data augmentation, and transfer learning. Moreover, observing that black-box techniques are not trustworthy for users, I broadened my scope towards the development of collaborative and explainable commonsense agents. My collaborative methods combine neural and symbolic techniques for mental modeling, state tracking, and planning, while my explainable methods are based on interpretable learning, large-scale knowledge resources, and analogical reasoning. My research on commonsense AI has been constantly informed by cognitive psychology ideas such as analogy, prototype learning, and lateral thinking. These directions have attracted the attention of a variety of funding agencies: developing methods for procedural reasoning over stories has been funded by personal grants from NSF and ARL, the application of commonsense AI to traffic has been supported by an industrial gift, applications of our knowledge graph toolkit (#9) have inspired funding by the Swiss government, AFRL, and Novartis, while my methods for scene imagination in stories (#5) attracted joint funding from USC/ISI and ARL to develop coherent dialogue agents.

Seeing VUA’s leadership in Hybrid Intelligence, I decided to return to the Netherlands and accept a position as a Senior Assistant Professor (UD1) of Computer Science. My vision at VUA is to address the challenge that my research has led me to over the years: how to develop synergistic AI agents with common sense, designed to effectively augment people’s ability to perform complex tasks such as problem-solving and counterfactual reasoning. This vision unifies my four research thrusts in my proposed Vidi research on analogical reasoning over what-if questions.

As a leader in neuro-symbolic AI, generalization, and commonsense reasoning, I have been publishing books, chapters, and refereed articles in top-tier journals and conferences, developing tools, and actively chairing workshops, tutorials, competitions, and symposiums. I have been a guest editor for special issues on commonsense reasoning in the Semantic Web Journal and the Neurosymbolic AI journal. I am frequently approached to serve as a reviewer and area chair for major conferences and to participate in

## Current and Past Collaborators
I believe firmly in teamwork. In my PhD years, I have closely collaborated with my mentors ([Piek Vossen](https://vossen.info/), [Marieke van Erp](https://mariekevanerp.com/), [Stefan Schlobach](http://www.few.vu.nl/~schlobac/), and [Frank van Harmelen](https://www.cs.vu.nl/~frankh/)), with Ed Hovy who I visited at CMU in 2017, with the LOD Laundromat/Triply team ([Wouter Beek](https://wouterbeek.github.io/) and [Laurens Rietveld](http://laurensrietveld.nl/)), and with [Marten Postma](https://www.researchgate.net/profile/Marten-Postma-2/2). Through successful collaborations, I co-authored publications with other European researchers, including [Giuseppe Rizzo](http://giusepperizzo.github.io/), [Raphael Troncy](https://www.eurecom.fr/en/people/troncy-raphael), and [Ruben Izquierdo Bevia](https://rizquierdobevia.wordpress.com/). My mentor at ISI has been [Pedro Szekely](https://usc-isi-i2.github.io/szekely/), with whom I have been working closely on a wide range of topics covering knowledge graphs, language modeling, and neuro-symbolic reasoning. Together with [Alessandro Oltramari](https://www.bosch.com/research/know-how/research-experts/alessandro-oltramari-ph-d/) and [Jon Francis](https://scholar.google.com/citations?user=7CLS0LwAAAAJ&hl=en) from Bosch Research and [Kaixin Ma](https://www.lti.cs.cmu.edu/people/222218877/kaixin-ma) from CMU we have been developing methods for [zero-shot Question Answering](https://ojs.aaai.org/index.php/AAAI/article/view/17593), [generalizable model adaptation with lower data dependency](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2109.02837.pdf), and procedural understanding (under review). In collaboration with Alessandro, Kaixin, Pedro, and [Deborah McGuinness (RPI)](https://faculty.rpi.edu/node/36134), we identified 13 [dimensions of common sense](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2101.04640.pdf) based on existing sources. I have been collaborating with Jay Pujara on tasks involving [numeric reasoning](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2103.13136.pdf), [story generation and explanation](https://openreview.net/pdf?id=WnIpeFJgSZy), and [analogical reasoning](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2206.07167.pdf). With [Fred Morstatter](https://www.isi.edu/~fredmors/) we have been exploring biases in both [factual](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2108.05412.pdf) and [commonsense](https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=9769935) knowledge graphs. In collaboration with [Xiang Ren](https://shanzhenren.github.io/) and [Peifeng Wang](https://www.isi.edu/directory/peifengw/), we have been investigating novel neuro-symbolic methods for commonsense reasoning, based on [path generation](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2005.00691.pdf) and [scene imagination](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2112.06318.pdf). Other joint projects with Pedro Szekely are centered around the Wikidata knowledge graph, focusing on its [quality](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S1570826821000536), [link prediction](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2203.13965.pdf), and [similarity](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2108.05410.pdf). The main backbone for these is the [Knowledge Graph ToolKit (KGTK)](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2006.00088) - a comprehensive set of operations for working with modern, hyperrelational graphs like Wikidata.

As of late 2023, my key collaborators include Kaixin Ma (text-based games and brain teasers; CMU/Tencent), Riccardo Tommasini (internet meme knowledge graphs; INSA Lyon), Pia Sommerauer (analogical reasoning; VU Amsterdam), Mahyar Khayatkhoei (visual reasoning; USC/ISI), Jay Pujara (knowledge-based AI for food recommendation; USC/ISI), Jon Francis (text-based games; Bosch Research), Hong-An Sandlin (misinformation and hate speech; armasuisse), Kiril Gashteovski (human-centric NLP; NEC Labs), and Sascha Saralajew (interpretable machine learning; NEC Labs).

## For Postdocs and (prospective) students
I enjoy working with Postdocs and students. In fact, many of the research results highlighted above have been guided by PhD, MSc, or undergraduate students. I have various interesting projects students can work on, relating to the three key themes in my team: commonsense reasoning, human-centric NLP, and AI for social good. We explore challenging tasks such as story understanding, fact verification, and question answering. I am actively hiring strong and passionate Master or PhD students for either a paid position or directed research. The chance is high that I am also hiring a Postdoc when you read this. If your CV shows the right skills, I will send you a programming exercise and interview you to discuss projects. I meet weekly with my students to ensure steady progress and address challenges.
