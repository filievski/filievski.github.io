## What We Do

We investigate **human-centric AI systems with common sense** that can team with people intuitively and reliably.

We perform fundamental research on commonsense AI and investigate its application to challenging domains, informed by **empirical insights and cognitive theories**.

**Research Topics:**

1. **Intelligence studies:** We evaluate the ability of AI models to exhibit cognitive phenomena. Our recent work focuses on analogical reasoning, visual abstraction and generalization, lateral thinking, and perceiving objects of various sizes and with various properties.
2.  **Neuro-symbolic methods for commonsense reasoning:** We develop methods for neuro-symbolic commonsense reasoning. Recently, these include methods using prototype-based networks, combining LLMs with deterministic engines, relational analogical engines, inducing rules from structural resources, and reasoning with scene knowledge graphs. 
3. **AI for good:** We investigate how AI can serve the social good. Current domains of interest include 1) content safety online, where we address misinformation and hate speech in internet memes and logical fallacies; 2) what-if reasoning in traffic; 3) devising analogical and rule-based explanations in an education setting; and 4) informing sustainability policies through knowledge-based AI.
