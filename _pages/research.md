# Research

**Research interest:** I am developing robust and explainable neuro-symbolic technology with positive real-world impact, based on neural methods and high-quality knowledge. During my PhD, I worked on establishing identity of long-tail entities in text, which is challenging for AI because of their ambiguity, data sparsity, and the need for diverse implicit knowledge and its contextualization. After joining USC/ISI in late 2019, I have been focusing on the notorious challenge of commonsense reasoning in tasks like question answering, procedural reasoning, and story understanding. Our methods rely on neuro-symbolic reasoning, typically combining neural (language) models, machine learning, and knowledge graphs. Recently, I have been focusing on tailoring the developed methods to application domains, primarily intelligent traffic monitoring and healthcare.

**Collaborators:** I believe firmly in team work. In my PhD years, I have closely collaborated with my mentors ([Piek Vossen](https://vossen.info/), [Marieke van Erp](https://mariekevanerp.com/), [Stefan Schlobach](http://www.few.vu.nl/~schlobac/), and [Frank van Harmelen](https://www.cs.vu.nl/~frankh/)), with Ed Hovy who I visited at CMU in 2017, with the LOD Laundromat/Triply team ([Wouter Beek](https://wouterbeek.github.io/) and [Laurens Rietveld](http://laurensrietveld.nl/)), and with [Marten Postma](https://www.researchgate.net/profile/Marten-Postma-2/2). Through successful collaborations, I co-authored publications with other European researchers, including [Giuseppe Rizzo](http://giusepperizzo.github.io/), [Raphael Troncy](https://www.eurecom.fr/en/people/troncy-raphael), and [Ruben Izquierdo Bevia](https://rizquierdobevia.wordpress.com/). My mentor at ISI has been [Pedro Szekely](https://usc-isi-i2.github.io/szekely/), with whom I have been working closely on a wide range of topics covering knowledge graphs, language modeling, and neuro-symbolic reasoning. Together with [Alessandro Oltramari](https://www.bosch.com/research/know-how/research-experts/alessandro-oltramari-ph-d/) and [Jon Francis](https://scholar.google.com/citations?user=7CLS0LwAAAAJ&hl=en) from Bosch Research and [Kaixin Ma](https://www.lti.cs.cmu.edu/people/222218877/kaixin-ma) from CMU we have been developing methods for [zero-shot Question Answering](https://ojs.aaai.org/index.php/AAAI/article/view/17593), [generalizable model adaptation with lower data dependency](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2109.02837.pdf), and procedural understanding (under review). In collaboration with Alessandro, Kaixin, Pedro, and [Deborah McGuinness (RPI)](https://faculty.rpi.edu/node/36134), we identified 13 [dimensions of common sense](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2101.04640.pdf) based on existing sources. I have been collaborating with Jay Pujara on tasks involving [numeric reasoning](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2103.13136.pdf), [story generation and explanation](https://openreview.net/pdf?id=WnIpeFJgSZy), and [analogical reasoning](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2206.07167.pdf). With [Fred Morstatter](https://www.isi.edu/~fredmors/) we have been exploring biases in both [factual](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2108.05412.pdf) and [commonsense](https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=9769935) knowledge graphs. In collaboration with [Xiang Ren](https://shanzhenren.github.io/) and [Peifeng Wang](https://www.isi.edu/directory/peifengw/), we have been investigating novel neuro-symbolic methods for commonsense reasoning, based on [path generation](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2005.00691.pdf) and [scene imagination](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2112.06318.pdf). Other joint projects with Pedro Szekely are centered around the Wikidata knowledge graph, focusing on its [quality](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S1570826821000536), [link prediction](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2203.13965.pdf), and [similarity](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2108.05410.pdf). The main backbone for these is the [Knowledge Graph ToolKit (KGTK)](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2006.00088) - a comprehensive set of operations for working with modern, hyperrelational graphs like Wikidata.

**For students:** I enjoy working with students. In fact, many of the research results highlighted above have been guided by PhD, MSc, or undergraduate students. I have various interesting projects students can work on, including tasks like story understanding, fact verification, and question answering. I am actively hiring strong and passionate Master or PhD students for either a paid position or directed research. If your CV shows the right skills, I will send you a programming exercise and interview you to discuss projects. I meet weekly with my students to ensure steady progress and address challenges.
